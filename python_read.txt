For creating file management project in improvised way:

1. implement cloud storage implementation
AWS S3 Integration
1. pip install boto3

2.Enable File Search with Filters
use rapidfuzz for better performance
pip install rapidfuzz

3.Enable file search with filter
import time

pip install cryptography
This update enhances security & efficiency while keeping your existing functionality intact.

4. file compression and encryption 
import zipfile            #for compression
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet  # For encryption

5. Automatic file organization
Scans the provided directory and moves files into subfolders based on their extension 
(e.g., Documents, Images, Videos, Music, Archives, or Others).

6. Scheduled Auto-Organization
pip install schedule
import schedule           # For scheduling auto-organization
import time as t          # Used in the schedule loop
Uses the schedule module to run the organization process automatically at the interval (in minutes) you specify.

7. AI-Powered Features Menu:
(1) Extract text from image (OCR):
Reads an image file using pytesseract and prints the extracted text.
pytesseract (and ensure Tesseract OCR is installed on your system)
pillow
schedule (if not already installed)
pip install pytesseract pillow schedule
AI-Based Folder Suggestion: An AI assistant that reads file contents (images via OCR or text files) and 
then—using a simple NLP heuristic—suggests a folder name based on the most frequent meaningful words.


8. Logging and user activity tracking:
python built-in Logging module. Python’s built‐in logging module so that every major action 
(such as file creation, deletion, renaming, uploading, compressing, encrypting,organizing, version control, and AI operations)
recorded in a log file named file_management.log. 
This log will include timestamps, the logging level, and a message that includes the current user (obtained via getpass.getuser()).
import logging
import getpass

9. User Authentication and Role‐Based Access
using JWT (via the PyJWT library)
pip install pyjwt
Functions like rename_file() and delete_path() call require_admin(), 
so only an admin user (e.g., username "admin" with password "admin123") can perform these operations.
Depending on your role, admin-only options (rename, delete) will be allowed only for admin users.
